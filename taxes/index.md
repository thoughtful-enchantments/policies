# Taxes!

Taxes are an important part of functional society. Where our products are taxable, we collect and remit consumption tax to governments at the local, state, and/or federal levels. If your billing address is in one of the taxable jurisdictions, you’ll see a line item on your invoice for sales tax or VAT.

## Updating your billing address
If you need to change your billing information because you don’t actually reside in a taxable jurisdiction, you can easily handle that within your accounts. You may need to re-enter your credit card information as part of the billing address update.

## We’re here to help
Please [contact our Support team](68mf0oq3o@mozmail.com) if you have trouble or if:

* you believe you’re being charged in error.
* your organization is tax exempt or has a VAT identification number. Alongside your tax exempt certification or VAT identification number, please include your account ID or domain when you email us.

* you have any additional questions.
